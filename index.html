            <h1 class="rozdil">Erisia bosses</h1>
            <h1 class="fagnames">Duke Ishamon Erisia</h1><h2 class="infoaboutfags"> is a Boss the player fights during "The Lord Regent's Quest" and is located in Duke Erisia's Laboratory within Duke Erisia's Manor. Defeating him will give you the Talent “Attunement Unbound” and “Weapon Unbound,” but only if you have 75 Attunement and/or 75 Weapon upon executing him.Defeating him will also allow Galebreathe users to unlock the Pillars of Erisia mantra in a Whisper hand, a modified version of his Gale Stomp. He is a noble who resided in the City of Celtor before the Great Drowning. In appearance, the Duke is a Marten Celtor. He wears a Slate Aristocrat Coat over the Eager Tradesman starter outfit with Eyeglasses. He also has a Resonance by his side that allows him to create and control Rock Golems, although it is never visibly used during the boss fight. The Duke of Erisia is a martial arts user and is specialized in the Legion Kata style. Alongside his martial attacks, he wields extremely powerful and exclusive Galebreathe mantras. While the Duke is immune to instant guardbreaks, his posture pool is incredibly low, meaning most instant guardbreaks will still posture break him. With a Stone 10+ Weight Weapon, combined with a Heavy Hands Ring and Ardour Scream, you can oneshot his posture every M1.</h2>
            <h1 class="fagnames">Maestro Evengarde Rest</h1><h2 class="infoaboutfags"> is the master of the Temple of the Blade and the current Maestro of Etrea. A powerful individual, he will train and assist only those who he sees fit, so that Etrea, its people and its culture may not be swept away in the machinations of other nations.Upon challenging Maestro Evengarde Rest to a fight, the player is transported to the Temple Sparring Hall dungeon. Winning the fight will allocate the player a chest of rewards. If it is his first defeat, a guaranteed smaller chest will spawn, holding a unique weapon based on what weapon type you are using; (Purple Cloud for medium, Pale Briar for heavy, Cerulean Thread for light). Losing will cause the player to lose a life and gain the Disgraced flaw (which can be removed by eventually defeating him). After beating Evengarde once, you will not gain the Disgraced flaw upon further losses.</h2>
            <h1 class="rozdil">Song Seeker bosses</h1>
            <h1 class="fagnames">The Ferryman</h1><h2 class="infoaboutfags">is an instanced Boss fought at the Boatman's Watch within the Eastern Luminant's Void Sea. A strange figure referenced in old folklore of the surface world, he is member of the enigmatic race of Krulians and claims to be the closest bridge between the Drowned Gods and the people of Lumen.According to the stories of old, the Ferryman is a benevolent individual who bestows gifts upon those who summon him, though most fail to mention that these gifts aren't earned without a fight. The Ferryman actively despises the mortals who dwell on the surface, offering up unfair wagers, with the mortal betting their life, and him only betting a "Relic."According to Yamaketzal, he is an amalgamation of souls dredged up from the "dregs of the dregs." He was mistreated by the people of the surface and returns the favor by tormenting them.</h2>
            <h1 class="rozdil">Layer 1 bosses</h1>
            <h1 class="fagnames">Chaser, Scholar of the Crimson Contract</h1><h2 class="infoaboutfags">is a humanoid Boss that is fought in Floor 1 of the Second Layer. He is found within The Maw of Ethiron, specifically in the Cathedral of Ethiron. He is also a Black Diver, though in reality an operative serving The Ministry.He was once an aspiring Diver, graduating as one of the greatest of his generation, only surpassed by Klaris Llfiend, Mother of Lights and Akira.[1] Eventually, he betrayed the Divers, joining the Ministry instead. He served as an apprentice for and was gifted the ability of a Bloodrend-based Oath by the Ministry's Second Prophet, during which he developed the Flareblood Kamas.[2] Funnily enough, Chaser does not use the Flareblood Kamas at all during the fight.He allied himself with the mysterious Kyrsgarde and volunteered to lead an expedition into the Eternal Gale. However, by the time they reached the Second Layer, he tore the expedition apart, though Apprentice Diver Azel Corbet managed to record his fears and suspicions before being lost. Another expedition would then be sent, but that too was lost. A third expedition arrived to the Second Layer, but they soon ran out of food. Its members grew suspicious, Journeyman Diver Skeli recording that Chaser could no longer be trusted or allowed to reach the 'Forbidden City' and some tried to flee to the Ignition Union's nearby holdout, though they would be killed by Chaser. Eventually that expedition too would be wiped out.[3] Appearance-wise, he is a young male greymarch Adret characterized by his unique eye color and facial markings. He also has a Resonance that allows him to extract power from the effigies of the dead,[4] with the multiple bells on his hips representing those effigies. However, he is incapable of using them. His eyes are blood red and have a swirl pattern, likely as a result of his own variant of the Oath.</h2>
